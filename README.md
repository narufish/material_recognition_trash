# material_recognition_trash
This repository contains code for training and predictions from Mask R-CNN with ResNet101 and FBNetV3G with FPN for research on material recognition of waste objects. This research was done as my graduation research at Ritsumeikan University. The dataset used is a custom dataset consisting of TACO and self-taken images.
